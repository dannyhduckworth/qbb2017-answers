My gene that had the most significant p value (Mir3062) didnâ€™t show any results in Panther, so I went with the next significant p value, which was Lgals9. Based on the Panther output, this is a cell adhesion and signaling molecule. Based upon Uniprot data, Lgals9 binds galactoside and is involved in numerous processes, ranging from inhibiting natural killer cell function to activating macrophages.
